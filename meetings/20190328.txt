Meetings notes from the 28th of March



21:23 Meeting started
21:24 Change of matrot haamuta
- Amitai
- Jeremy
- Ronen
- Yaki
- Alon

Yonatan & Yair (not members)

Yonatan updating about help he gave the amuta
- we submitted mosad mitnadev
- we need to change the amuta purpose because what we submitted contradicts the "teudat hirashmut" of the amuta
- it also contradicts the reality, which is that we are in fact an open for the public place
- so it should be easy
- so she asked what changed since last year, which is not just the formal purpose change, but also that the place is no longer for living, but only for TAMI purposes
- she asks us to show what were the rejects: (5 yud)
 - we do not fit a criteria:
 - work in the areas where the local municipality works, including revacha, health, education, and likewise (criteria 6)
 - our stance, is that providing the service (repeating TAMI's purpose) does not fit that.

Yaki: this is incorrect. The local municipality asks the public to go to the internet and do stuff, like against building.
older people don't have that internet skill. If we, TAMI, provide that, then we are doing something for the public.

 (back to yonatan)
So to deal with this objection, we are rewriting the purpose.

(back to yaki)
you can find examples that the iria asks for people to go to a site, and show it is impossible from a phone, and requires a computer (which not everyone has, which TAMI provides)

(yonatan)
reading from the new purpose: (can repeat it from git)

(ronen)
I have one problem, if I remember correctly:
originally we submitted something short, then we submitted something long, and the rasham rewrote it to something short.

(I)
so can't the rasham change it?

(yonatan)
they only need us to show we submitted.
we need to provide a document reporting that and the changes we claimed.
- showing we are no longer supporting dwelling
- showing we rewrote that the purpose is to host the public, not members only.

(I)
lets cut to the chace

The vote on:
- from the forms, no change, short or long provided, which one do you want to submit? the long is what we had in the submission?
 - Amitai: long
 - Alon: long
 - Yaki: long
 - Ronen: long
 - Jeremy: long

Unanimous vote for the long form.

21:48 meeting is adjourned.
